### Smart Growth
As a trained urban planner and experienced [local housing advocate](https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/06/this-group-is-trying-to-make-sense-of-hawaiis-regulatory-landscape/), I know that continuing to pave over Ewa's prime agricultural land is not the right solution to Hawaii's housing affordability crisis. I will advocate for dense, mixed-use development in town and along the rail line to house more people while minimizing the impact on traffic and the environment.

### Homelessness
[Research has shown](https://www.sightline.org/2022/03/16/homelessness-is-a-housing-problem/) that homelessness is primarily a problem of housing supply and affordability.

### Economic Development
Ewa needs more jobs. Instead of forcing ourselves and our neighbors to sit on the H-1 for hours every day, we should be creating high-paying opportunities in our own community. As a former small business owner and economic development researcher, I look forward to working with local businesses to grow and expand.
