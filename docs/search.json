    "text": "Trey‚Äôs Story\nTrey was born in 1990 to two public servants: Marv, then a young Army officer, and Kim, a special education teacher. From an early age, Trey enjoyed advocating for his peers through student government. He graduated near the top of his class from Jack Britt High School in Hope Mills, North Carolina, and was honored with the statewide DAR Good Citizen Award that same year.\nTrey studied international business in college with the goal of helping nonprofits become more effective and efficient. Along the way, though, he became interested in starting his own business that would make the world a better place. Two years after graduation, he founded Koios Library Software, which he ran for 6 years, growing it from an idea (to help public libraries reach their communities through Google) to a successful small business with 40 clients in the U.S. and Canada.\nInspired by the intelligence and determination of the librarians he met, Trey returned to the classroom for a ‚Äúdeep dive‚Äù into the workings of state and local government, focusing on land use, housing, and technology. During this time, he also worked as a researcher in economic development, helping distressed communities create more opportunity for local residents. After graduation, Trey began a two-year fellowship that uses his technology skills to help create a more effective, equitable Federal government.\nHe met his wife, Andrea‚Äìa fellow public servant‚Äìat an engagement party for mutual friends in 2014, and they were married in 2016. Their son, Winston, was born at Queens in October."

    "text": "Homelessness\nThe primary reason for both homelessness and brain drain is that Hawaii isn‚Äôt building enough homes. When many people compete for few places to live, we are forced into a cruel game of musical chairs where home prices, rents, and property assessments all rise until the least wealthy residents are priced out‚Äìforced either to the mainland or the street. I will work with county officials to address the housing crisis at the source, making room on our island for our keiki and our homeless neighbors. I will also petition our leaders to prioritize Haubush and other Ewa hotspots for rehabilitation programs.\n\n\nTraffic\nWhile I advocate for more homes and more neighbors, as a trained urban planner and land use expert, I know that continuing to pave over Ewa‚Äôs prime agricultural land is not the best solution to Hawaii‚Äôs housing crisis. I will advocate for dense, mixed-use development concentrated in town and along the rail line to provide the affordable housing our island needs while minimizing traffic and environmental impact.\n\n\nJobs\nEwa needs more good jobs. Instead of forcing ourselves and our neighbors to idle on the H-1 for hours every day, we should be creating well-paying opportunities right here in our own community. As a former small business owner and researcher in economic development, I look forward to helping local businesses grow and expand, and coordinating with the Kapolei and Waipahu neighborhood boards to foster sustainable, equitable prosperity in the greater Ewa area."
