    "text": "In the battle A third of all vacant prime land for development on Oahu is located on the Ewa Plain. The current west end of the rail line is in Ewa. Ewa’s rich farmland provides food\n\n\n\n\nTrey learned the importance of public service at an early age from his parents, an Army officer and a teacher. He has 4 younger siblings\n\nmilitary brat\nhusband/parent\ncivic technologist\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a trained urban planner and experienced local housing advocate, I know that continuing to pave over Ewa’s prime agricultural land is not the right solution to Hawaii’s housing affordability crisis. I will advocate for dense, mixed-use development in town and along the rail line to house more people while minimizing the impact on traffic and the environment.\n\n\n\nResearch has shown that homelessness is primarily a problem of housing supply and affordability.\n\n\n\nEwa needs more jobs. Instead of forcing ourselves and our neighbors to sit on the H-1 for hours every day, we should be creating high-paying opportunities in our own community. As a former small business owner and economic development researcher, I look forward to working with local businesses to grow and expand.\n\n\n\n\nVoting begins April 28 and ends May 19.\nIn Neighborhood Board elections, voting is online-only at this website: https://web1.hnl.info/nbe/starter.
