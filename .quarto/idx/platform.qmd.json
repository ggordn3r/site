The current west end of the rail line is in Ewa. Ewa's rich farmland provides food \n\n## About/Trey's Story\nTrey learned the importance of public service at an early age from his parents, an Army officer and a teacher. He has 4 younger siblings\n\n- military brat\n- husband/parent\n- civic technologist\n\n## Issues/Priorities\n### Smart Growth\nAs a trained urban planner and experienced [local housing advocate](https://www.civilbeat.org/2022/06/this-group-is-trying-to-make-sense-of-hawaiis-regulatory-landscape/), I know that continuing to pave over Ewa's prime agricultural land is not the right solution to Hawaii's housing affordability crisis. I will advocate for dense, mixed-use development in town and along the rail line to house more people while minimizing the impact on traffic and the environment.\n\n### Homelessness\n[Research has shown](https://www.sightline.org/2022/03/16/homelessness-is-a-housing-problem/) that homelessness is primarily a problem of housing supply and affordability.\n\n### Economic Development\nEwa needs more jobs. Instead of forcing ourselves and our neighbors to sit on the H-1 for hours every day, we should be creating high-paying opportunities in our own community. As a former small business owner and economic development researcher, I look forward to working with local businesses to grow and expand.\n\n## How to Vote\nVoting begins **April 28** and ends **May 19**.  \n\nIn Neighborhood Board elections, **voting is online-only at this website**: [https://web1.hnl.info/nbe/starter](https://web1.hnl.info/nbe/starter).
